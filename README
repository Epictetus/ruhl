Ruhl (Ruby Hypertext Language)

This project is here to flesh out an idea.  What I want is to have developers work with HTML and with the simple addition of a 'ruby' attribute (and a file extension change), convert it to a dynamic page.

Notes (use cases) for me to remember:

Use the repeater pattern:

<ul id="aab" ruby="@results">
 <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet</li>
 <li>consectetur adipiscing elit</li>
</ul>

@results would know how to represent itself in the context of the ul element.  In other words, it would know how to produce <li> elements.


<h1 ruby="@post">

@post would know how to represent itself in the context of the h1 element.


The ruby executed would replace the content of the element it was being called on.  In addition, the ruby attribute would be removed from the output.

Now to see if/how this will work.
